# JourneyJournal

I've been tasked with developing an app to assist people chronicle their trip experiences. This program will save a list of travel-related diary entries, as well as the images linked with each entry. The software will also be able to geotag journal entries and connect with other native apps and hardware, such as the camera.


The prototype

Core requirements of the app:
● User registration and login.
● Main home area of the app.
● Create a journal entry.
● Manage my journal entries.
  ○ Delete entry.
  ○ Edit entry.
